## üìÅ Projects

### üí≥ [Credit Card Fraud Detection](./FraudDetector/)
Uses logistic regression and random forests to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Includes precision, recall, and confusion matrix evaluation.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Binary classification
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Feature scaling
- Evaluation metrics

---

### [Sudoku Solver](./SudokuSolver/)
Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking and NumPy arrays. Great for demonstrating recursive logic and constraint-solving with numerical data.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Backtracking algorithm
- Recursive problem solving
- Grid-based logic using arrays

---

## Tools & Libraries

- `numpy`
- `pandas` (in some projects)
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

---

## Coming Soon

- Matrix operations and visualizations
- Conway‚Äôs Game of Life
- NumPy-based simulation of physical systems

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anannya-punia/numpy-projects.git
   cd numpy-projects
   ```

2. Navigate into any project folder and follow its instructions (`README.md`).
