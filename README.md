# üî¢ Sudoku Solver (with NumPy)

A Python script that solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles using a recursive backtracking algorithm. This project is part of a collection of NumPy-focused learning projects.

---

## üß† How It Works

The puzzle is represented as a 9x9 NumPy array, with empty cells marked as `0`. The algorithm:

1. Finds the next empty cell
2. Tries placing numbers `1‚Äì9` into that cell
3. Checks if the number is valid (row, column, 3x3 box)
4. Recursively continues until the puzzle is solved

If a placement leads to a dead end, the algorithm backtracks and tries a new number.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or copy this folder into your workspace
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install NumPy:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python sudoku_solver.py
    ```

## üì¶ Requirements

Only NumPy is required:

## üèóÔ∏è Future Ideas

- Add support for different grid sizes
- Build a GUI with tkinter or PyGame
- Add a generator to create puzzles


## Sample Output
